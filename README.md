how to properly and securely configure the entire php.ini file for the latest version of PHP

# Introduction:

1. This is the single best place to go to look up php.ini values: http://php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php. See what each value that you want to learn about does, if current values in your php.i.ni file have been deprecated in the current release, etc.

# Further Information:
1. If you need to check what the secure configuration value should be for most values, you can do that. 
2. Later will add a file that looks exactly like the php.ini file you get with default PHP installation to make replacing it a cinch
3. Also going to add a file that focuses SPECIFICALLY on the most important security values so you can go in and change specific lines on a current php installation
